# Odin Restaurant Page

This is my take on the 'Restaurant Page' project from `The Odin Project`, specifically the Webpack module in the JavaScript course (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page). The website is basic, simple, with a little bit of responsiveness too. This project was done to learn Webpack.
